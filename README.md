# Dust Protocol

Private payment infrastructure for EVM chains. Send and receive untraceable payments using stealth addresses, `.tok` names, and a ZK privacy pool for unlinkable fund withdrawal.

Currently deployed on **Thanos Sepolia** and **Ethereum Sepolia**.

## Features

- **Stealth Addresses** — Payments go to one-time addresses that can't be linked to your identity
- **ERC-4337 Stealth Accounts** — Each stealth address is an ERC-4337 smart account. The recipient's private key never leaves the browser — client signs the UserOperation locally
- **`.tok` Names** — Human-readable addresses (`alice.tok`, `coffee.alice.tok`)
- **Payment Links** — Create shareable links for receiving payments
- **No-Opt-In Payments** — Anyone can send to a `.tok` name from any wallet, no special software needed
- **Paymaster-Sponsored Gas** — All claims are gasless via DustPaymaster. The on-chain paymaster sponsors gas through ERC-4337, with auto-top-up when deposits run low
- **Real-time Scanning** — Automatic detection of incoming payments (supports legacy EOA, CREATE2, and ERC-4337 account announcements)
- **Unified Dashboard** — Single balance view aggregating unclaimed stealth payments + claim wallet holdings, with per-address breakdown
- **Multi-Chain Support** — Chain selector in sidebar, switch between Thanos Sepolia and Ethereum Sepolia. All API routes, hooks, and scanner are chain-aware
- **DustPool (ZK Privacy Pool)** — Withdraw funds from multiple stealth wallets into a single fresh address with zero on-chain linkability via Groth16 ZK proofs
- **Privacy Swaps** — Trade any token with full privacy using Uniswap V4 hooks and ZK proofs. Deposit to privacy pool, generate proof, execute swap to stealth address with zero on-chain linkability

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

```
RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=<deployer-private-key>
```

Contract addresses and RPC URLs are configured per-chain in `src/config/chains.ts`. No per-chain env vars needed.

#### The Graph (optional)

To use The Graph for faster name queries instead of direct RPC calls:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL_THANOS=https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<STUDIO_ID>/dust-protocol-thanos/version/latest
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL_SEPOLIA=https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/<STUDIO_ID>/dust-protocol-sepolia/version/latest
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_GRAPH=true
```

See [docs/GRAPH_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/GRAPH_DEPLOYMENT.md) for full setup instructions.

## How It Works

### Stealth Payments

1. **Connect wallet** and derive stealth keys from a signature + PIN
2. **Register a `.tok` name** linked to your stealth meta-address
3. **Share your name** — senders visit `yourname.tok` to pay privately
4. **Scan & claim** — the app detects payments and auto-claims via ERC-4337 UserOperations (gasless)

### No-Opt-In Stealth Payments

From [Interactive No-Opt-In Stealth Addresses](https://ethresear.ch/t/interactive-no-opt-in-stealth-addresses/23274) — the receiver's pay page pre-generates a one-time stealth address and shows it as a plain address + QR code. Any wallet (MetaMask, exchange, hardware wallet) can send to it without stealth-aware software.

```
Page loads → GET /api/resolve/{name} → server generates stealth address + announces on-chain
Page shows address + QR → sender copies and sends from any wallet
Sender can close the page — announcement already exists on-chain
Receiver's scanner discovers the payment automatically
```

**How it preserves privacy:** Each name query generates a fresh ephemeral key pair server-side. The stealth address is an ERC-4337 smart account derived from the receiver's public spending key + the ephemeral key via ECDH. Only the receiver (with their viewing key) can identify the payment. The on-chain announcement happens *before* payment (eager pre-announcement), so the page can be closed at any time.

### Privacy Swaps

Trade tokens with full privacy using Uniswap V4 hooks and zero-knowledge proofs:

1. **Deposit to DustPool** — Deposit ETH or USDC with a Poseidon commitment
2. **Generate ZK proof** — Prove you own a deposit without revealing which one
3. **Execute private swap** — Swap via Uniswap V4 with proof in hookData, output sent to stealth address
4. **Zero linkability** — No on-chain connection between deposit and swap

**Gas optimizations:**
- O(1) Merkle root lookup (~208k gas saved)
- Optimized circuit with 6 public inputs (~13k gas saved)
- Storage packing and hardcoded zero hashes (~26k gas saved)
- Total: ~247k gas savings (51% reduction)

**Contracts:** DustSwapPoolETH, DustSwapPoolUSDC, DustSwapHook (Uniswap V4), Groth16 verifier

## Architecture

### ERC-4337 Stealth Accounts

Each stealth payment address is an ERC-4337 smart account deployed via CREATE2.

```
Sender pays to predicted account address (no contract deployed yet — just an address with funds)
    ↓
Receiver's scanner detects payment via on-chain announcement
    ↓
Browser derives stealth private key via ECDH
    ↓
POST /api/bundle → server builds UserOp with paymaster signature
    ↓
Browser signs the userOpHash locally (key never leaves the browser)
    ↓
POST /api/bundle/submit → server calls entryPoint.handleOps()
    ↓
EntryPoint deploys account + drains funds to recipient in one tx
DustPaymaster pays all gas — claim is completely gasless for the user
```

**Why ERC-4337?** The stealth private key never leaves the browser. The client only signs a UserOperation hash — the server never sees the key. The DustPaymaster sponsors gas on-chain through EntryPoint, making claims trustlessly gasless. The paymaster auto-refills its deposit when it runs low.

**Backward compatibility:** The scanner supports all three wallet types — legacy EOA, CREATE2 (`StealthWalletFactory`), and ERC-4337 accounts. Legacy payments are still claimable via `/api/sponsor-claim`.

### DustPool: ZK Privacy Pool

Without the pool, claiming stealth payments drains every wallet to the same claim address — linking them on-chain. DustPool breaks this link using zero-knowledge proofs.

#### The Problem

```
Stealth Wallet A (5 ETH) ──→ Claim Address 0xABC
Stealth Wallet B (3 ETH) ──→ Claim Address 0xABC  ← ALL LINKED
Stealth Wallet C (7 ETH) ──→ Claim Address 0xABC
```

An observer sees all stealth wallets drain to the same address. Privacy is destroyed.

#### The Solution

```
DEPOSIT (all mixed into one pool):
  Stealth Wallet A ──→ DustPool (commitment₁)
  Stealth Wallet B ──→ DustPool (commitment₂)
  Stealth Wallet C ──→ DustPool (commitment₃)

WITHDRAW (unlinkable via ZK proof):
  DustPool ──→ Fresh Address 0xNEW (15 ETH)
  Nobody can tell which deposits map to which withdrawal.
```

#### How It Works

**Deposit flow:**
1. Browser generates random `secret` + `nullifier`
2. Computes `commitment = Poseidon(Poseidon(nullifier, secret), amount)`
3. Stealth wallet drains to sponsor (via existing claim infrastructure)
4. Sponsor calls `DustPool.deposit{value: amount}(commitment)`
5. Commitment is inserted into an on-chain Poseidon Merkle tree (depth 20, 1M capacity)
6. Browser stores `{secret, nullifier, leafIndex}` in localStorage

**Withdraw flow (withdrawal):**
1. Browser lazy-loads snarkjs + circuit artifacts (WASM 1.7MB + zkey 5.2MB)
2. For each deposit: generates a Groth16 ZK proof proving:
   - "I know the secret behind one of the commitments in this Merkle tree"
   - Without revealing **which** commitment is mine
3. Submits proof to contract — verifier confirms the math, sends funds to fresh address
4. `nullifierHash = Poseidon(nullifier, nullifier)` prevents double-spend without linking back to the commitment

**Why it's untraceable:**
- Commitments are hashes — nobody can reverse them to find the depositor
- The ZK proof reveals zero information about which leaf/deposit is being withdrawn
- The nullifier hash prevents double-spend but can't be linked to the original commitment without the private nullifier
- Privacy grows with the anonymity set — more deposits = stronger privacy

#### Circuit

`DustPoolWithdraw.circom` — ~5,900 non-linear constraints, Groth16 on BN254.

| Signal | Visibility | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `root` | Public | Merkle tree root (must match on-chain) |
| `nullifierHash` | Public | Double-spend prevention |
| `recipient` | Public | Where funds go |
| `amount` | Public | Withdrawal amount |
| `nullifier` | Private | Known only to depositor |
| `secret` | Private | Known only to depositor |
| `pathElements[20]` | Private | Merkle proof siblings |
| `pathIndices[20]` | Private | Left/right path bits |

Trusted setup: Hermez `powersOfTau28_hez_final_15.ptau` (2^15 = 32,768 constraints capacity).

#### User Experience

The pool toggle on the dashboard controls the flow:

- **Toggle OFF**: Payments are claimed directly to your claim address (standard flow)
- **Toggle ON**: Eligible payments (CREATE2/ERC-4337) are held for manual pool deposit. User sees a "Deposit N payments to Pool" button and explicitly triggers the deposit. EOA payments are skipped (no smart contract wallet to drain).
- **Withdraw**: When pool deposits exist, a balance card appears with a "Withdraw" button. Opens a modal where you enter a fresh recipient address. ZK proofs are generated in-browser (~1-2s each), then submitted on-chain.

#### Gas Costs

All gas is sponsored by the relayer:

| Operation | Gas | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| Deposit | ~6.8M | Poseidon Merkle insert across 20 depth levels |
| Withdraw | ~350K | Groth16 pairing verification + ETH transfer |

### Security Model

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| **Stealth addresses** | ECDH key agreement — only the receiver can derive the private key |
| **PIN-based keys** | SHA-512(signature + PIN) — stealth keys require both wallet + PIN |
| **Private key isolation** | Stealth private keys stay in browser memory (React ref, not state) |
| **CREATE2/4337 claims** | Client signs locally, sponsor relays — key never sent to server |
| **DustPool privacy** | Groth16 ZK proofs — withdrawal is cryptographically unlinkable to deposit |
| **Double-spend prevention** | Nullifier hash revealed on withdrawal — contract rejects reuse |
| **Replay protection** | Chain-scoped signatures (EIP-712 domain includes chainId) |
