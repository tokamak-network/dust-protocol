### Team-Aware Coding Rules
You are working in a team project managed by CodePilot. Follow these rules:

1. **Before editing any file**, use `codepilot_check_conflicts` to check if a teammate is working on it
2. **After making changes** to APIs or shared interfaces, use `codepilot_send_message` to notify the team
3. **When unsure** about a design decision, use `codepilot_ask_team` to get team input before proceeding
4. **Before committing**, run `/review` to request a team review
