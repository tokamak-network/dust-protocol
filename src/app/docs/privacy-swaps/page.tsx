          Even after privately receiving ETH through stealth transfers, swapping reveals a pattern. The amount
          you deposit to a DEX and the timing form a unique fingerprint. An on-chain analyst can cluster
          multiple stealth wallets as belonging to the same user just by watching who swaps similar amounts
          at similar times.
        </p>

          Privacy Swaps (<code className="text-xs bg-[rgba(255,255,255,0.06)] px-1.5 rounded-sm">DustSwap</code>)
          solve this with <strong>fixed denominations</strong> and a Uniswap V4 hook that validates a
          ZK proof atomically inside the swap transaction — so the on-chain record never links a specific
          deposit to a specific swap output.
