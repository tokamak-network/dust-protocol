        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed mb-4">
          On any public EVM chain, every transaction is permanently visible. When someone pays you at your regular
          wallet address, anyone can: see your total balance, trace every prior payment, learn your income, and
          profile your spending habits. Sharing your address is a privacy risk.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-[rgba(255,255,255,0.6)] leading-relaxed">
          Stealth transfers solve this by making each payment land at a fresh, unlinkable, one-time address — while
          still being discoverable by the recipient through a secret only they hold.
