          Dust Protocol is an on-chain privacy layer built on top of standard EVM infrastructure. It lets users send,
          receive, and swap tokens without creating a public ledger trail — the fundamental privacy problem that
          affects every public blockchain today.

          When you receive ETH normally, the entire world can see your address balance, income history, and spending
          patterns. Dust eliminates this by routing all payments through{" "}
          <strong className="text-white">one-time stealth addresses</strong> — each payment lands at a fresh address
          that only the recipient can derive.
